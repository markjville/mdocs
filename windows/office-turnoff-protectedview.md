# Turn off Protected View in MS Office

Enable or disable security alerts on the Message Bar

1. In an Office program, click the *File* tab.
2. Click *Options*.
3. Click *Trust Center*, and then click *Trust Center Settings*.
4. Click *Message Bar*. The *Message Bar Settings for all Office Applications* dialog box appears.

◦ *Show the Message Bar in all applications when document content is blocked.*

This is the default. The Message Bar appears when potentially unsafe content has been disabled. 

Note: The option is not selected, and the Message Bar does not appear, if you select *Disable all macros without notification* in the Macro Settings area of the Trust Center.

◦ Never show information about blocked content. This option disables the Message Bar and no alerts appear about security issues, regardless of any security settings in the Trust Center.
