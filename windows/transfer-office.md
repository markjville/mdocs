# Transfer MS Office to new computer.

Note: this only applies to retail versions of Office, not OEM. Use cscript (path to OSPP.VBSD) /dstatus to determine which version.

## For Office 2010 and 2013:

1. Find the product key.
2. Uninstall Office from old computer. Make sure to have internet connection active.
3. Install Office on new computer.
4. Activate Office.

Note: If the default activation method fails with the “too many installations” error, you’ll need to do the activation over the phone. If that’s the case, use this Microsoft-provide link (here) to find and call the toll-free number associated with your country of residence. Once you call it, wait patiently until you are offered the option to talk with an answer tech, then explain that you are transferring the license from an old computer. They are obliged to help you to complete the activation process. 

## For Office 2016:

1. Uninstall office from old computer.
2. Install on new computer.
3. If Activation was not already done, in the Activation Wizard select I want to activate the software by telephone, and then select Next. If nothing happens when you select Next, use the Enter key on your keyboard.

• Under Step 1 in the Activation Wizard, select your country/region, and then call the Product Activation Center phone number that’s listed under the country/region you selected. 

• When prompted by the Product Activation Center, provide the Installation ID that's shown in the Activation Wizard under Step 2.

• The Product Activation Center will provide a Confirmation ID that you enter in the Activation Wizard under Step 3.

• Select Next and follow the prompts to complete the activation process. If nothing happens when you select Next, use the Enter key on your keyboard.
