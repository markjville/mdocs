This is a collections of tech recipes and similar tech documentation.

It often happens that when setting up some new thing (server, application, Db, etc...) we have a general idea how to setup and after which the thing fails to run. The problem is always in the details of the configuration, which we tend not know or have forgotten. Or maybe there are recurring issues and one can't remember how it was solved last. This repository contains my recipes and solutions so that I may build from scratch or fix the thing in question with those pesty details documented.
