# Welcome to mDocs!

This is a collections of tech recipes and similar tech documentation.

It often happens that when setting up some new thing (server, application, Db, etc...) we have a general idea how to setup and after which the thing fails to run. The problem is always in the details of the configuration, which we tend not know or have forgotten. This repository contains my recipes used in production so that I may build from scratch the thing in question with those pesty details documented.
