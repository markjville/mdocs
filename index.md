# Configs, cheatsheets, & tips!

It often happens that when setting up some new _thing_ (server, application, Db, etc...) we have a general idea how to setup and after which the thing fails to run. The problem is always in the details of the configuration, which we tend not to know or have forgotten. This repository contains my recipes and tips used in production at work or home so that I may build from scratch the _thing_ in question with those pesty details documented.

Below are various categories with tasty tips and succulent configs.
